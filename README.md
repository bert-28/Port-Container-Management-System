# Port-Container-Management-System
This program simulates a port system where containers are stored in a stack and ships line up in a queue, allowing storing, viewing, and loading operations.

The program has two classes: Container and Ship, each with fields and a toString() method for easy printing.

In the main class, it uses an ArrayDeque as a stack to hold containers and another ArrayDeque as a queue to hold ships.
The user interacts through a menu with options to:

• Store a new container (push to stack).

• View all containers from top to bottom.

• Register a ship (enqueue to queue).

• View all waiting sbhips.

• Load the next ship by popping the top container and polling the first ship.
